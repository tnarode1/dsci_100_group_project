This dataset contains data on digital images of leaves from 40 different species of plants.
There are 443 rows in this data set in total, each representing a single leaf, and 443 RGB coloured images of said leaves, one for each row.
Each coloured image was photographed over a red or pink background with an Apple iPad 2 and is 24-bit, with a resolution of 720 Ã— 920 pixels. 
There are also 340 black-and-white binary photos of every leaf from every plant species with simple leaves, which are species 1-15 and 22-36.
All other plant species in this dataset (species 16-21 and 37-40) have complex leaves. 
Each row of the .csv file contains the species number of a given leaf (column 1) and its specimen ID number (column 2), 
followed by 14 of its shape (columns 3-9) and texture (columns 10-16) attributes. 
The .csv file does not have column names, so here they are for clarity:
1. Class (Species)
2. Specimen Number
3. Eccentricity
4. Aspect Ratio
5. Elongation
6. Solidity
7. Stochastic Convexity
8. Isoperimetric Factor
9. Maximal Indentation Depth
10. Lobedness
11. Average Intensity
12. Average Contrast
13. Smoothness
14. Third moment
15. Uniformity
16. Entropy
