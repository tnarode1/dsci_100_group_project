Activity #1: Explore Datasets - Preliminary

Group project assignment details on Canvas

One person should code, the rest of the group should direct the coding process

Using what you have learnt in weeks 1-4, read the dataset, take a look at it, and write a short description about the dataset.

Some questions you should try to answer:

* What is the dataset about?
* How many variables are there?
* How many observations are there?

Activity #2: Explore Datasets Part 2 - Outcome Variable

Now, someone else should take over the coding!

Try to answer these questions now:

Identify the main outcome/categorical/label variable in the dataset.

* How many values/groups are in this variable?
* How many observations are there in each value/group?

Tip: Think about how you are organising your workbook: add more code and markdown cells (and arranged them!) to keep your notebook neat

Activity #3: Explore Datasets Part 3 - Visualisations!

Make some visualisations of the outcome variable:

* What does the distribution of the variable look like?
* What relationship does it have with some of the other variables?

Tip: Try using a range of box plots, scatterplots, bar charts, line graphs, etc.
